Tuition Fees:

For the September 2018 program start date, tuition and fees for the entire 16-month Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC) program are estimated at approximately:

$22,000 CDN for domestic students (Canadian citizens and permanent residents)
$50,000 CDN for international students
We expect, but cannot guarantee, that tuition costs will be more than offset by internship salaries. Student may be eligible to apply for graduate scholarships.

Fall-term tuition fees are posted to the University of Toronto Student Accounts website in mid-July each year.
